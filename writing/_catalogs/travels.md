> It is not necessarily at home that we best encounter our true selves. The furniture insists that we cannot change because it does not; the domestic setting keeps us tethered to the person we are in ordinary life, who may not be who we essentially are. â€” _Alain de Botton_

Deep in my heart of hearts, I am a homebody, and while I won't say I _dislike_ traveling it is something akin to running for me: a rich and rewarding endeavor which I tend to only fully appreciate once I'm back home, my back aching and my legs tired.
