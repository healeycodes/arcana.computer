Hello! I'm Justin Duke. I've been writing on the internet since 2013; I've been writing on this site since 2020.

I'm an engineer at Stripe and I built and currently run Buttondown and Spoonbill.

You might notice that some of these links aren't clickable yet â€” that's because I haven't written them.
